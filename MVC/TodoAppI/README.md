# TodoApp

This is a basic Todo application built with ASP.NET Core and a JavaScript frontend.

### Features
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Todo items.
- In-memory database for quick setup.
- Minimal API endpoints.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `TodoAppI` project directory.
2. Run `dotnet run`.
3. Open your browser to the URL provided in the terminal.

### Challenges
Still struggling with the frontend-related things. Especially separation of concerns. I tried the module pattern at first. But I decided to use classes instead. I also had trouble with the separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. I had to refactor the code to make it more in line with the new JavaScript module. But then suddenly I had several more files than I knew what to do with.

### Lessons
TypeScript works really easily in a C# project. First time using it like this.
